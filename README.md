ðŸ’œ About Me
===========

### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Ashley Ajuz. I am a Software Engineer at Github currently working with the Authorization team! Ever since taking my first high-school CS class, I've developed a passion for technology and strive to design and develop **efficient** and **reliable** software for everyone. It is also my hope that I can utilize technology to help enhance and facilitate the lives of as many people as possible. I am truly looking forward to growing in my career here at Github and becoming the best engineer that I can be!
